* Virtualization:
Virtualization is a technology to run multiple same or different os,
which is completely isolated from each other. Which means separating
hardware from a single operating system. each ¡°guest¡± OS is managed by
a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), also known as a hypervisor. ex:- run
both linux and windows on the same machine
** Advantages:
  -  Reduce number of servers.
  -  Reduce TCO (Total Cost Ownership).
  -  Improve availability and business continuity.
  -  Increase efficiency for development and test environments.
  -  Improve availability of your virtual environment.
** Virtualization Types
1). Hardware virtualization

Hardware virtualization refers to taking the components of a real
machine and making them virtual. This virtual machine works like the
real machine and is usually a computer with an operating system.

*Ex:=* VMware ESX, MS Virtual Server, Xen and others.

2). OS-level Virtualization:

Operating-system-level virtualization is a server-virtualization
method, where the kernel of an operating system allows for multiple
isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Such instances
(sometimes called containers, software containers, virtualization
Engines (VE), virtual private servers (VPS), or jails) may look and
feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and
users.

*Ex:=*  Openvz, Chroot, Jails

*** Hypervisor:

A hypervisor is a hardware virtualization technique that allows
multiple guest operating systems (OS) to run on a single host system
at the same time. The guest OS shares the hardware of the host
computer, such that each OS appears to have its own processor, memory
and other hardware resources.

A hypervisor is also known as a virtual machine manager (VMM).

*** How does it work?

The servers would need to execute the hypervisor. The hypervisor, in
turn, loads the client operating systems of the virtual machines. The
hypervisor allocates the correct CPU resources, memory, bandwidth and
disk storage space for each virtual machine.

A virtual machine can create requests to the hypervisor through a
variety of methods, including API calls.

There are two types of hypervisors:

1. Embedded or hosted hypervisors, and
2. Bare metal or native hypervisors.

Hypervisors can be divided into two types:

*** Bare metal, native or type I hypervisors

This is when the hypervisors are run on the host's hardware to control it as well as manage the virtual machines on it.

If you are currently using Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor, VMware ESX/ESXi, Oracle VM Server for x86, KVM, or Citrix XenServer, then this is the type of hypervisor with which you are working.

*** Embedded, hosted or type II hypervisors

These hypervisors are run as a software using an operating system such as Windows, Linux or FreeBSD. This is what the Virtage hypervisor, VirtualBox and VMWare Workstation are classified as.

So, native hypervisors run directly on the hardware while a hosted hypervisor needs an operating system to do its work. Which one is better? It depends on what you're after.

Bare metal hypervisors are faster and more efficient as they do not need to go through the operating system and other layers that usually make hosted hypervisors slower. Type I hypervisors are also more secure than type II hypervisors.

Hosted hypervisors, on the other hand, are much easier to set up than bare metal hypervisors because you have an OS to work with. These are also compatible with a broad range of hardware.

* Virtual Box:

A VirtualBox is a software virtualization package that installs on an operating system as an application.

VirtualBox allows additional operating systems to be installed on it, as a Guest OS, and run in a virtual environment.

To Install VirtualBox using Various Commands:

Add the VirtualBox own repository to install latest VirtualBox 5.0 on following systems.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo
#+END_EXAMPLE
Install Dependency Packages for VirtualBox:

VirtualBox uses vboxdrv kernel module to control and allocate physical memory for execution of guest operating systems. Without this module,

you can still use the VirtualBox to create and configure virtual machines, but they will not work. So, to make VirtualBox fully functional

you will need to update your system first, then install some additional modules like DKMS, kernel-headers and kernel-devel and some dependency packages.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yum update
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yum install binutils qt gcc make patch libgomp glibc-headers glibc-devel kernel-headers kernel-devel dkm
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Install VirtualBox 5.0:

Once you¡¯ve installed all the needed dependency packages, you can install latest version of VirtualBox using following command.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yum install VirtualBox-5.0
#+END_EXAMPLE
