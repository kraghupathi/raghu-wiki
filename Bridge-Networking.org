* Bridge:
- Bridge is a device that connects two LANs and controls data flow between them.
- Especially bridge is a store & forward device. During the connection of different LANs, it receives the frame from one LAN and transfer the same
  frame without encapsulating or without modification to other LAN. By using local and remote bridge, a network administrator can easily extend the network distance.
** The difference between switch and bridge
-  Bridge is device which divides a network into two and Switch connects multiple networks.
-  Bridge are software based and switch is a hardware based.
-  Bridge can have upto 16 ports while switch can handle many ports.
-  Bridge is rarely used. Switches are frequently used. 
* Switch:
- Switch is a device which is used to connect the same network elements.
* Router:
- Router is a device which is used to connect different network elements.
* Setting Up Bridge to form a sample network.
** Introduction:
- Here I explained about how to create a bridge on CentOS and how to form a sample network
  using bridge by connecting OpenVZ container.
** Creating a bridge: 
- Bridge is basically a file configured with essential settings which mentions
  the bridge name, boot protocol, on boot settings, type and if it is to be
  network manager controlled. 
- Change directory to network-scripts directory
#+begin_example
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
#+end_example
- To create the bridge, create a file with name ifcfg-br1 in the current
  directory including the following settings:
#+begin_example
touch ifcfg-br1
#+end_example
- Add the following configurations
#+begin_example
DEVICE=br1
TYPE=Bridge
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
#+end_example
 * Restart network service to effect the changes.
#+begin_example
service network restrat
#+end_example
 * Following command can be issued to list all the bridges created and the
   interfaces they are connected to.
#+begin_example
brctl show
#+end_example
- The output has to contain the created bridge and any other bridges previously created with connected interfaces.
  With current configuration used, a sample output can be seen below:
#+begin_example
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br1		8000.000000000000	no	         
#+end_example
** Diagram
- I have implemented a sample network which satisfied below diagrame
[[./Untitled%20drawing.jpg]]

** Creating private subnet:
- To test the settings we can create our own private subnet with three test containers.
#+begin_example
vzctl create 101 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64 --hostname centos-1
vzctl create 102 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64 --hostname centos-2
vzctl create 103 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64 --hostname centos-3
#+end_example
- Note that ip address is not set for creating the containers.
- set the netfilter to full for the containers.
#+begin_example
vzctl set 101 --netfilter full --save
vzctl set 102 --netfilter full --save
vzctl set 103 --netfilter full --save
#+end_example
- The containers needs to be connected to the bridge br0.This is achieved by connecting with the respective interfaces. This is done by the following commands:
#+begin_example
vzctl set 101 --netif_add eth0,,,,br1 --save
vzctl set 102 --netif_add eth1,,,,br1 --save
vzctl set 103 --netif_add eth2,,,,br1 --save
#+end_example
- Start the containers and set its status to running.
#+begin_example
vzctl start 101
vzctl start 102
vzctl start 103
#+end_example
* Configuring Containers:
- Enter into the container 101
#+begin_example
vzctl enter 101
#+end_example
Change directory
#+begin_example
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
#+end_example
ifcfg-eth0 file should contain the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=00:18:51:9A:D8:E5
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=10.2.59.101
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
#+end_example
- Enter into the container 102
#+begin_example
vzctl enter 102
#+end_example
ifcfg-eth1 file should contain the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=eth1
HWADDR=00:18:51:97:0D:0C
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=10.2.59.102
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
#+end_example
- Enter into the container 103
#+begin_example
vzctl enter 103
#+end_example
- ifcfg-eth2 file should contain the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=eth2
HWADDR=00:18:51:86:A8:F3
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=10.2.59.103
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
#+end_example
- Restart the network services in all above containers 101,102 and 103 using
  below command  and check if the eth0, eth1 and eth2 are assigned to
  ip-address or not (ifconfig command).

#+begin_example
service networking restart
#+end_example
*Note :-* The hardware address can be known by the command =ifconfig -a=.
* Testing ping command among each container
- Now try to ping each container with one another if we are able ping each
  other then our network is formed successfully.
- ping 102 container from 103 container
#+begin_example
ping 10.2.59.102
#+end_example
- ping 101 container from 103
#+begin_example
ping 10.2.59.101
#+end_example
*Conclusion* I am able to ping above ip's
